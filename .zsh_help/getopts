getopts optstring name [ arg ... ]
       Checks the args for legal options.  If the args are omitted, use the positional parameters.  A valid option argument b
       `-'.   An  argument  not  beginning  with a `+' or a `-', or the argument `--', ends the options.  Note that a single 
       valid option argument.  optstring contains the letters that getopts recognizes.  If a letter is followed by a `:', tha
       have an argument.  The options can be separated from the argument by blanks.

       Each  time  it is invoked, getopts places the option letter it finds in the shell parameter name, prepended with a `+'
       `+'.  The index of the next arg is stored in OPTIND.  The option argument, if any, is stored in OPTARG.

       The first option to be examined may be changed by explicitly assigning to OPTIND.  OPTIND has an initial value of 1, a
       1  upon  exit from a shell function.  OPTARG is not reset and retains its value from the most recent call to getopts. 
       OPTARG is explicitly unset, it remains unset, and the index or option argument is not stored.  The option itself is st
       this case.

       A  leading  `:' in optstring causes getopts to store the letter of any invalid option in OPTARG, and to set name to `?
       and to `:' when a required option is missing.  Otherwise, getopts sets name to `?' and prints an error message when  a
       The exit status is nonzero when there are no more options.
