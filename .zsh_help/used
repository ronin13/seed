printf format [ arg ... ]
       Print  the arguments according to the format specification. Formatting rules are the same as used in C. The same escap
       are recognised in the format. All C conversion specifications ending in one of csdiouxXeEfgGn are handled. In addition
       used instead of `%s' to cause escape sequences in the argument to be recognised and `%q' can be used to quote the argu
       allows it to be reused as shell input. With the numeric format specifiers, if the corresponding argument starts with a
       numeric  value of the following character is used as the number to print otherwise the argument is evaluated as an ari

       as an identifier which is created as an integer parameter.

       Normally,  conversion  specifications are applied to each argument in order but they can explicitly specify the nth ar
       replacing `%' by `%n$' and `*' by `*n$'.  It is recommended that you do not mix references of this explicit style with
       the handling of such mixed styles may be subject to future change.

       If arguments remain unused after formatting, the format string is reused until all arguments have been consumed. With

       or an empty string had been specified as the argument.
