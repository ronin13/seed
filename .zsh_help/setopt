setopt [ {+|-}options | {+|-}o option name ] [ name ... ]
       Set the options for the shell.  All options specified either with flags or by name are set.

       If  no arguments are supplied, the names of all options currently set are printed.  The form is chosen so as to minimi
       the default options for the current emulation (the default emulation being native zsh, shown as <Z> in zshoptions(1)).
       by  default for the emulation are shown with the prefix no only if they are off, while other options are shown without
       if they are on.  In addition to options changed from the default state by the user, any options activated automaticall
       example,  SHIN STDIN  or  INTERACTIVE) will be shown in the list.  The format is further modified by the option KSH OP
       rationale for choosing options with or without the no prefix remains the same in this case.

       If the -m flag is given the arguments are taken as patterns (which should be quoted to protect them from filename expa
       with names matching these patterns are set.
