return [ n ]
       Causes  a  shell  function or `.' script to return to the invoking script with the return status specified by n.  If n
       status is that of the last command executed.

       If return was executed from a trap in a TRAPNAL function, the effect is different for zero and non-zero return status.
       after an implicit return at the end of the trap), the shell will return to whatever it was previously processing; with
       shell will behave as interrupted except that the return status of the trap is retained.  Note that the numeric  value 
       caused  the  trap is passed as the first argument, so the statement `return $((128+$1))' will return the same status a
       been trapped.
