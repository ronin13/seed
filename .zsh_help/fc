       Select a range of commands from first to last from the history list.  The arguments first and last may be specified  a
       string.  A negative number is used as an offset to the current history event number.  A string specifies the most rece
       the given string.  All substitutions old=new, if any, are then performed on the commands.

       If the -l flag is given, the resulting commands are listed on standard output.  If the -m flag is also given the first
       pattern (should be quoted) and only the history events matching this pattern will be shown.  Otherwise the editor prog
       a file containing these history events.  If ename is not given, the value of the parameter FCEDIT is used; if that is 
       the parameter EDITOR is used; if that is not set a builtin default, usually `vi' is used.  If ename is `-', no editor 
       ing is complete, the edited command is executed.

       If first is not specified, it will be set to -1 (the most recent event), or to -16 if the -l flag is given.  If last  
       will be set to first, or to -1 if the -l flag is given.

       The flag -r reverses the order of the commands and the flag -n suppresses command numbers when listing.

       Also when listing,
       -d     prints timestamps for each command
       -f     prints full time-date stamps in the US `MM/DD/YY hh:mm' format
       -E     prints full time-date stamps in the European `dd.mm.yyyy hh:mm' format
       -i     prints full time-date stamps in ISO8601 `yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm' format
       -t fmt prints time and date stamps in the given format; fmt is formatted with the strftime function with the zsh exten
              %D{string} prompt format in the section EXPANSION OF PROMPT SEQUENCES in zshmisc(1).  The resulting formatted s
              than 256 characters or will not be printed.
       -D     prints elapsed times; may be combined with one of the options above.

       `fc  -p'  pushes  the current history list onto a stack and switches to a new history list.  If the -a option is also 
       list will be automatically popped when the current function scope is exited, which is a much better solution than crea

       `fc  -P'  pops  the  history  list back to an older list saved by `fc -p'.  The current list is saved to its $HISTFILE

       `fc -R' reads the history from the given file, `fc -W' writes the history out to the given file, and `fc -A' appends t
       given  file.  If no filename is specified, the $HISTFILE is assumed.  If the -I option is added to -R, only those even
