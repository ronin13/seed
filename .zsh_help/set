set [ {+|-}options | {+|-}o [ option name ] ] ... [ {+|-}A [ name ] ] [ arg ... ]
       Set the options for the shell and/or set the positional parameters, or declare and set an array.  If the -s option is 
       specified arguments to be sorted before assigning them to the positional parameters (or to the array name if -A is use
       ments in descending order.  For the meaning of the other flags, see zshoptions(1).  Flags may be specified by name usi
       option name is supplied with -o, the current option states are printed:  see the description of setopt below for more 
       mat.  With +o they are printed in a form that can be used as input to the shell.

       If the -A flag is specified, name is set to an array containing the given args; if no name is specified, all arrays ar
       their values.

       If  +A is used and name is an array, the given arguments will replace the initial elements of that array; if no name i
       are printed without their values.

       The behaviour of arguments after -A name or +A name depends on whether the option KSH ARRAYS is set.  If it is not set
       ing  name  are  treated  as values for the array, regardless of their form.  If the option is set, normal option proce
       point; only regular arguments are treated as values for the array.  This means that

              set -A array -x -- foo

       sets array to `-x -- foo' if KSH ARRAYS is not set, but sets the array to foo and turns on the option `-x' if it is se

       If the -A flag is not present, but there are arguments beyond the options, the positional parameters are set.  If the 
       terminated by `--', and there are no further arguments, the positional parameters will be unset.

       If  no arguments and no `--' are given, then the names and values of all parameters are printed on the standard output
       is `+', the names of all parameters are printed.

       For historical reasons, `set -' is treated as `set +xv' and `set - args' as `set +xv -- args' when in any other  emula
       native mode.
