       Change  the current directory.  In the first form, change the current directory to arg, or to the value of $HOME if ar
       arg is `-', change to the value of $OLDPWD, the previous directory.

       Otherwise, if arg begins with a slash, attempt to change to the directory given by arg.

       If arg does not begin with a slash, the behaviour depends on whether the current directory `.' occurs in the list of d
       the  shell parameter cdpath.  If it does not, first attempt to change to the directory arg under the current directory
       cdpath is set and contains at least one element attempt to change to the directory arg under each component of cdpath 
       ful.  If `.' occurs in cdpath, then cdpath is searched strictly in order so that `.' is only tried at the appropriate 

       If no directory is found, the option CDABLE VARS is set, and a parameter named arg exists whose value begins with a sl
       the directory.  In that case, the parameter is added to the named directory hash table.

       The second form of cd substitutes the string new for the string old in the name of the current directory, and tries to
       directory.

       The  third  form  of cd extracts an entry from the directory stack, and changes to that directory.  An argument of the
       stack entry by counting from the left of the list shown by the dirs command, starting with zero.  An argument of the f
       the right.  If the PUSHD MINUS option is set, the meanings of `+' and `-' in this context are swapped.

       If the -q (quiet) option is specified, the hook function chpwd and the functions in the array chpwd functions are not 
       for calls to cd that do not change the environment seen by an interactive user.

       If the -s option is specified, cd refuses to change the current directory if the given pathname contains symlinks.  If
       or the CHASE LINKS option is set, symbolic links are resolved to their true values.  If the -L option is given symboli
       the directory (and not resolved) regardless of the state of the CHASE LINKS option.

chdir  Same as cd.
