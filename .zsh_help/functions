functions [ {+|-}UXkmtuz ] [ name ... ]
functions -M mathfn [ min [ max [ shellfn ] ] ]
functions -M [ -m pattern ... ]
functions +M [ -m ] mathfn
       Equivalent  to  typeset -f, with the exception of the -M option.  Use of the -M option may not be combined with any of
       typeset -f.

       functions -M mathfn defines mathfn as the name of a mathematical function recognised in all forms of arithmetical expr
       tion  `Arithmetic  Evaluation'  in zshmisc(1).  By default mathfn may take any number of comma-separated arguments.  I
       have exactly min args; if min and max are both given, it must have at least min and and at most max args.  max may be 
       there is no upper limit.

       By  default  the function is implemented by a shell function of the same name; if shellfn is specified it gives the na
       shell function while mathfn remains the name used in arithmetical expressions.  The name of the function in $0  is  ma
       would usually be the case), provided the option FUNCTION ARGZERO is in effect.  The positional parameters in the shell
       the arguments of the mathematical function call.  The result of the last arithmetical expression evaluated inside the 
       it is a form that normally only returns a status) gives the result of the mathematical function.

       functions  -M  with no arguments lists all such user-defined functions in the same form as a definition.  With the add
       list of arguments, all functions whose mathfn matches one of the pattern arguments are listed.

       function +M removes the list of mathematical functions; with the additional option -m the arguments are treated as pat
       whose  mathfn matches the pattern are removed.  Note that the shell function implementing the behaviour is not removed
       its name coincides with mathfn).

       For example, the following prints the cube of 3:

              zmath cube() { (( $1 * $1 * $1 )) }
              functions -M cube 1 1 zmath cube
              print $(( cube(3) ))

autoload [ {+|-}UXktz ] [ -w ] [ name ... ]
       Equivalent to functions -u, with the exception of -X/+X and -w.

       The flag -X may be used only inside a shell function, and may not be followed by a name.  It causes the calling functi
       autoloading and then immediately loaded and executed, with the current array of positional parameters as arguments.  T

       The flag +X attempts to load each name as an autoloaded function, but does not execute it.  The exit status is zero (s

       With  the -w flag, the names are taken as names of files compiled with the zcompile builtin, and all functions defined

       The flags -z and -k mark the function to be autoloaded in native or ksh emulation, as if the option KSH AUTOLOAD  were
       respectively.  The flags override the setting of the option at the time the function is loaded.
